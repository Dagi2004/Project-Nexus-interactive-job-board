**Challenges Faced**

During the development of this project, several challenges were encountered and overcome:

**Vercel 404 Error:**

- Issue: After deployment, some routes returned a 404 error on page refresh.

- Solution: Configured the vercel.json file to handle client-side routing by redirecting all routes to index.html.

**Context State Management:**

- Issue: Managing global state (e.g., saved jobs, user authentication) across multiple components was initially complex.

- Solution: Implemented React Context API to efficiently manage and share state across the application.
